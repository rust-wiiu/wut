Rust bindings (and so much more) for the [devkitPro Wii U Toolchain](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut). The toolchain is a collection of libraries using [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) PPC compiler tools to write homebrew software for the Nintendo Wii Uâ„¢.

For information regarding installation, usage, etc take a look at [Book for U](https://rust-wiiu.github.io/book-for-u/). General information can be found found at [rust-wiiu README](https://github.com/rust-wiiu/.github/blob/main/profile/README.md).
